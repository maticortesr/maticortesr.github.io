    <p>Hi! I'm Matias. Welcome to my place on the Internet. The main purpose of this site is to unify my online presence and showcase my skills, interests, and the projects on which I'm working. </p>
<p>I'm from Chile, a very long and thin country in South America with many of the most beautiful and diverse natural landscapes out there. My two main interests have always been technology and entrepreneurship (besides my obsession with tennis). So, at 17, when I had to make the decision about what to do in college for the next six years, my options were clear: Computer Science or Industrial Engineering. I opted for the latter one with the intention of learning about businesses and starting one in the future. In the process, I learned about many different topics that opened my mind to new problems, and I fell in love with my major.</p>
<p>During college, I had the incredible experience of founding a startup, Radart, which was aimed at connecting artists and community members through cultural events. It was an amazing period of time where I was outside of my comfort zone and grew a lot as a person and as a professional, from learning to think strategically to overcome challenges and uncertainty to developing a user-centric mindset and improving my communication skills, due to all of the interaction with users and investors. We shut down after a year and a half, but I  gained many lessons and experiences that shape how I work today.</p>
<p>My passion for technology was of course still there, so when I finished college I discovered the beautiful world of Data Science, which keeps me busy nowadays. Data Science was the field I was looking for throughout my work in college, as it combines the technology and the business understanding on which I have always wanted to focus. My major gave me the formative skills but, since it is a new field, I have to keep studying constantly to stay up to date, which is something I really enjoy.</p>
<p>After working in data analytics for two years at an international company, I moved to the Boston area where I currently live.</p>
<p>Please take a tour of the site and contact me with any questions, comments, or job proposals. </p>

      <description>Table Tennis gear shopping can be a complex endeavor. When you get to the point of getting a custom racket, combining a blade + 2 Rubbers gives you pretty high number of combinations. For example, a blade can be made of wood or wood+carbon for the most part, with a variety of combinations in terms of ply (usually 5-7) and they are classified as Defensive, Offensive and All around, with many levels in between.</description>

      <description>This is the inaugural post of the new version of my personal website powered by Hugo and Go. The plan for this website is to become public record of projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on, a knowledge base of technical topics and my way to get into writing. Writing is Thinking I read recently, and I totally agree. Engligh is also not my native language so this blog will definetly help me to improve my english skills as well.</description>

      <description>Text Classification on Table Tennis Rubbers:  Text Classification with Scikit-Learn. Extracted data with Selenium and hand-labeled examples to build a classifier. AUC: 0.957 and Accuracy: 0.87.
Skills: Sklearn Pipelines, Text Classification, Text Features, NLTK, Spacy
  Abstractive Text Sumarization:  Abstractive text summarization. Used an Encoder-Decoder arquitecture with attention and pre-trained embeddings (GloVe). Beam search used for inference. Rouge scores: Rouge-1, 23.27; Rouge-2, 15.30; Rougue-L: 24.47.</description>

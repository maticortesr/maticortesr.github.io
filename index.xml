      <description>This is the inaugural post of the new version of my personal website powered by Hugo and Go. The plan for this website is to become public record of projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on, a knowledge base of technical topics and my way to get into writing. Writing is Thinking I read recently, and I totally agree. Engligh is also not my native language so this blog will definetly help me to improve my english skills as well.</description>

      <description>After creating a text classifier on Part 1 of this series of analysis on Table Tennis equipment, there is another aspect of choosing equipment that is tricky: making sense of all the specs of rubbers. Luckily, Revspin.net has user-generated data we can use for this. Characteristics like Speed, Spin, Control, Gears, Tackyness are rated from 1 to 10 for a big number of rubbers. The issue with this is that is very hard to make sense of all those numbers, Revspin does not offer a comparison tool currently, and even if it did, typical 1-to-1 comparison toolsfall short when you want to find similar products.</description>

      <description>Table Tennis gear shopping can be a complex endeavor. When you get to the point of getting a custom racket, combining a blade + 2 Rubbers gives you pretty high number of combinations. For example, a blade can be made of wood or wood+carbon for the most part, with a variety of combinations in terms of ply (usually 5-7) and they are classified as Defensive, Offensive and All around, with many levels in between.</description>
